## Methods

We have already gone through the main content of the PRML textbook in our PBL reading group, where we have learned about methods for regression, classification, and clustering, etc. As an exercise, I have prepared problems that cover some common methods for classification and clustering.

  

The methods we aim to cover are as follows:

  

1. Logistic Regression

2. Support Vector Machine

3. Neural Network

4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

5. Gaussian Mixture Model using the EM Algorithm

  
  
  

## Homework

I have already prepared 5 code exercises for the methods listed above.

You can access the codes either through: https://github.com/yuzhe-li/PBL2024_exercise

or via databox: https://databox.naist.jp/f/11634609

### Your task

Your task is to complete the incomplete code to solve a classification, PCA, or clustering problem using the provided data.

  

### Requirement

To earn credit for the PBL course, you need to choose at least two of the exercises to complete as your homework.

And of course, you are welcome to attempt all the methods if you would like.

  
  

## How to use
